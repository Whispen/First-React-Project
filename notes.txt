What is Typescript?

Typescript is a superset of JS that allows us to add static typing, allowing us to catch errors sooner in the 
development process.

What is React?

React is a JS library created by Meta in 2011. It is used for building dynamic & interactive user interfaces. 
It does this by utilizing components, which allow us to simplify the process of building webpages by making the
process more modular, reusable, and organized. 

React components have the file extension of .tsx, as opposed to the standard .ts for vanilla TypeScript.

Industry standard for React Components is PascalCase.
