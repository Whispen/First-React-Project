What is Typescript?

Typescript is a superset of JS that allows us to add static typing, allowing us to catch errors sooner in the 
development process.

What is React?

React is a JS library created by Meta in 2011. It is used for building dynamic & interactive user interfaces. 
It does this by utilizing components, which allow us to simplify the process of building webpages by making the
process more modular, reusable, and organized. 

React components have the file extension of .tsx, as opposed to the standard .ts for vanilla TypeScript.

Industry standard for React Components is PascalCase. 



STEPS FOR MAKING GITHUB LIVE PAGE W/ VITE REACT

1. Add gh-pages package:
	npm install gh-pages --save-dev

2. Add to package.json:
	"predeploy": "npm run build",
  	"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"

3. Add to vite.config.ts:
	 base: '/First-React-App/', // Use the correct repository name here

4. Build and Deploy the app:
	npm run build	//This will launch the local vite server at the same time. You can exit out of this live server with CTRL + C
	npm run deploy	//This publishes the react app to the live page on github.

5. Select the source for pages in your github repo to gh-pages branch (this branch is initialized when you downlaod the gh-pages package locally and push the app via "npm run deploy".)

6. Navigate to your live page at https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-branch-name>/
